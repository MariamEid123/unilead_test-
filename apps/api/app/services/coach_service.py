"""AI Coach service — wired to the AI Education orchestrator.

The original mock returned a fixed ``COACH_SCRIPT`` indexed by ``turn_index``.
This wired version builds a ``CoachTurnRequest`` for the
``AICoachOrchestrator`` and translates its ``CoachTurnResponse`` back into
the Areta-facing ``CoachResponse`` shape.

Falls back to a deterministic script if anything goes wrong with the LLM
provider — the orchestrator already does this internally via
``FallbackEngine``, but we add a second safety net here so the route never
500s on a coach error.
