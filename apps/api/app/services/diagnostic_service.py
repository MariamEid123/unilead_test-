"""Diagnostic service — wires the AI Education DiagnosticEngine.

The original mock just reflected the current competency state back. The
wired version scores each answer against the correct option, builds an
initial ``DiagnosticAssessment``, runs it through ``DiagnosticEngine`` to
update the AI Education student model, and derives per-competency
misconceptions from incorrect answers.

The misconception mapping is intentionally simple: each diagnostic question
is tagged with the misconception its wrong answers most commonly indicate
(e.g. answering "Proportional" to the derivative-gain question suggests
``MISSING_DERIVATIVE_UNDERSTANDING``).
