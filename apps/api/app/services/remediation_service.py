"""Remediation service — uses the AI Education RemediationEngine.

Builds a ``RemediationPlan`` from the student's recent failure evidence
and translates it to the Areta-facing schema. The plan picks one of four
actions based on the detected misconception (e.g. EXCESSIVE_PROPORTIONAL_GAIN
→ ADJUST_PARAMETER_STEP with a focus on reducing Kp).

The ``conceptual_focus`` and ``diagnostic_question`` come from the
remediation strategy table (not the plan itself) — the plan only carries
the misconception + action + steps.

After computing the response, the plan is persisted to the DB
(``remediation_plans`` table) so the instructor dashboard can see it.
