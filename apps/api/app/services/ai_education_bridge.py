"""Bridge between the UniLead MVP state and the AI Education engine.

The UniLead MVP (originally Platform/backend) keeps its student state in
``student_state.py`` as a plain Python dict, with competency IDs like
``"feedback-fundamentals"``. The AI Education engine (``services/ai_education``)
keeps its own state in a ``StudentModelManager`` (Pydantic), with competency
IDs like ``"MEC271-FB"``. The two state stores must be kept in sync so the
existing UniLead routes (``/api/competencies``, ``/api/progress``) reflect
what the AI Education engines actually do.

This module is the only place that knows about both worlds. Everything else
in ``services/`` talks to either UniLead state or the AI Education gateway —
never both.
