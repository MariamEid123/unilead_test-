"""Per-student AI Education manager pool.

Each logged-in student needs its own AI Education state — the
``StudentModelManager`` keeps competency graph, evidence history, etc. in
memory. The Areta routes no longer share one global manager; instead,
each request resolves the manager from the current user's ``student_id``.

The pool is a plain dict keyed by ``student_id`` with LRU eviction
(max 200 entries). It lives on ``app.state.ai_education_managers``.
The pool is in-process — when the server restarts, the in-memory
managers are rebuilt from the DB on next access
(see ``load_manager_for_student``).

The DB is the source of truth for *what* the student has demonstrated.
The manager is rebuilt from the DB by re-recording every simulation run
as PracticalEvidence, then re-applying the latest diagnostic placement
and each transfer promotion to match the persisted Areta snapshot.
(Coach messages don't carry evidence in the AI Education sense.)
