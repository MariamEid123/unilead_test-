"""Areta API application package.

Importing this package registers the ``services/ai_education`` library on
``sys.path`` so it is importable without pip-installing it. Doing this in
the package ``__init__`` (rather than relying on ``import app.config``
coming first) means ``from ai_education import ...`` works anywhere in the
app regardless of import order. See also the identical bootstrap in
``app.config`` (kept for standalone script usage); both are idempotent.
