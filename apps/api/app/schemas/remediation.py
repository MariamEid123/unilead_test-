"""Schemas for the Remediation endpoint.

Remediation is offered when a student has ≥2 consecutive failing simulation
attempts on a competency. The ``RemediationEngine`` analyses the failure
telemetry, picks an action (EXPLAIN_CONCEPT / ADJUST_PARAMETER_STEP /
REVIEW_PREREQUISITE / RESET_EXPERIMENT), and returns a micro-lesson with
guided questions + steps.
