"""Schemas for the AI Coach endpoint.

The original mock schema only accepted ``turn_index``; the wired version
accepts an optional ``mode`` (one of the six CoachMode values) and an
optional ``competency_id`` so the orchestrator can build a richer context.
The response now exposes the orchestrator's ``active_mode``,
``scaffolding_level``, and any ``suggested_actions`` produced by the mode
handler.
